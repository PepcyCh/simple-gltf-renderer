# Simple glTF Renderer

A toy renderer to render scenes that are loaded from `.gltf` files and play with kinds of shaders. (But it can only do limited things now... I'll try to make it better in the future...)

It is also a project for me to try to write something about CG in Rust. Actually, it is the first Rust project for me.
